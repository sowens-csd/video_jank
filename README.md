# video_jank

An example project to demonstrate video stutter using the video_player plugin. 

## Getting Started

1. Build and run the application on an iOS device, not a simulator. 
2. A video should start playing.
3. Swipe to the next page.
4. The video will stall or stutter. 
5. Click the screen, the video should smooth back out. 

Either the application is using video_player incorrectly or there's an issue with video_player. 
The goal of this example is to help figure out the cause. See the [Screen Recording](https://github.com/sowens-csd/video_jank/VideoJankScreenRecording.mov)
